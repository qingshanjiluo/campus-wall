# Build for kungal's Nuxt 4 frontend (apps/web, Nitro node-server preset).
#
# Build context is the repo root (pnpm workspace: apps/web + apps/api). KunUI is
# now consumed as the published @kungal/ui-nuxt npm layer (a normal dependency
# resolved from node_modules), so there is no local packages/ui to copy in.
#
# Public runtime config (apiBase, oauth client, image/wiki URLs) is read by
# nuxt.config.ts from process.env at BUILD time, so it is passed as build args
# and baked. Any public key can still be overridden at RUNTIME via the
# canonical NUXT_PUBLIC_* env names (build once, configure per env — see
# docker/README.md).
