#
# Tools image: EVERY apps/api/cmd/* binary in one image, for kungal's one-off
# migration / backfill jobs the api/migrate images don't carry — e.g. the
# deferred migrations (005/006/007/012/015), check-dup-email,
# backfill-provider-names (see docs/migration + docs/deploy/03-bootstrap.md §B).
#
# The per-service Dockerfile builds ONE binary (ARG CMD); this bundles them all
# and invokes a job by name:
#
#   docker run --rm --network kun-galgame-infra_default \
#     --env-file docker/api.env ghcr.io/kunmoe/kungal-tools backfill-provider-names
#
# kungal has no cgo → pure static binaries. Build context MUST be the repo root.
