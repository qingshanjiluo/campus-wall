All code through version **5.0.70** was written entirely by hand. The last fully hand-written revision is [v5.0.70 (commit b4ad59e)](https://github.com/KunMoe/kun-galgame-forum/tree/b4ad59eb77d3eaf36d082aa528651039816e1dfa).

## Architecture

This repository is a **pnpm workspace monorepo** containing a Go API and a Nuxt frontend. It is a downstream application of [`kun-galgame-infra`](https://github.com/KunMoe/kun-galgame-infra), the identity and shared-service hub for the KUN ecosystem.

| Package    | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/api` | **Go Fiber v3 BFF and REST API** — owns forum data and interactions, enriches responses, talks to shared services, and runs scheduled synchronization jobs                             |
| `apps/web` | **Nuxt 4 SSR frontend** — Vue pages, components, Pinia state, validation, SEO, and browser interaction; Nitro serves feeds, sitemap data, content-image handling, and legacy redirects |

The forum owns topics, replies, messages, resources, ratings, quizzes, collections, toolsets, local counters, and its PostgreSQL schema. Shared capabilities remain single-sourced in infra:

| Capability                                      | Source of truth                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity and user profile                       | OAuth; numeric user IDs stay identical across services                                        |
| Browser authentication                          | An opaque `kungal_session` cookie backed by Redis; OAuth tokens never live in browser storage |
| Moemoepoint balance and ledger                  | OAuth; the forum keeps only a cached local view where required                                |
| Visual novel metadata, claims, and edit history | Catalog; newly submitted works adopt the registry-issued work ID as their forum gid           |
| Avatars and content images                      | The content-addressed `image_service`                                                         |
| Galgame and resource comment threads            | The shared Community service                                                                  |
| Reports and enforcement                         | The shared Trust service                                                                      |
| Toolset archives                                | The shared Artifact service                                                                   |

The retired Galgame Wiki family is not a contract for new work. Some compatibility reads and notification surfaces remain temporarily while the catalog cutover finishes, but new submission, claim, review, and editing flows target Catalog.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 24+ with Corepack, Go 1.26+, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Meilisearch. Full local functionality also requires the OAuth, Catalog, Image, Artifact, Community, and Trust services from `kun-galgame-infra`.

Start the local shared platform first:

```bash
cd /path/to/kun-galgame-infra
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
# Optional: refresh the local databases with real-shaped, desensitized data.
./scripts/refresh-dev-db.sh
```

Then configure and start the forum:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install

cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env

# Applies this repository's routine local migrations.
pnpm migrate

# API: http://127.0.0.1:2334, Web: http://127.0.0.1:2333
pnpm dev
```

The checked-in environment examples target the local infra stack. See the [infra development-environment guide](https://github.com/KunMoe/kun-galgame-infra/blob/main/docs/dev-environment.md) for service profiles, database refreshes, and local credentials. Cross-repository identity migrations have additional ordering requirements documented in [docs/migration/user/README.md](docs/migration/user/README.md).

To run the forum in containers after the infra network is available:

```bash
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose up -d kungal-api web
```

See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for the complete container and deployment runbook.

## Development Boundaries

- Contract mirrors under `docs/oauth/`, `docs/image_service/`, and `docs/artifact/` are generated and read-only. Change their sources in `kun-galgame-infra`, then synchronize them through `kungal-docs`.
- Database schema changes require a numbered migration in `apps/api/migrations/`; the API never runs GORM AutoMigrate at startup.
- Frontend work should use KunUI components before introducing local replacements. KunUI itself is an upstream package and is not modified in this repository.
- Keep frontend and backend response shapes aligned. The Go API returns a stable `{ code, message, data }` envelope.
