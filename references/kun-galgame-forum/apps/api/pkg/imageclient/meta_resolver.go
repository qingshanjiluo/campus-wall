// MetaResolver wraps Client.MetaBatch with a permanent in-process cache.
//
// Image metadata (dimensions + ThumbHash) is immutable per content-addressed
// hash, so positive results are cached forever. Built for the markdown render
// path (server-rendered topic / reply / comment / note / intro): the renderer
// calls Resolve(hashes) SYNCHRONOUSLY, so the cache keeps warm renders network-
// free and a tight per-call timeout bounds the cold path.
//
// Misses (hashes image_service doesn't know) AND partial hits (a hash that is
// known but whose ThumbHash hasn't been computed/backfilled yet — width/height
// present, thumbhash empty) are deliberately NOT cached, so they light up on a
// later render once the backfill fills them in. Only complete entries (with a
// ThumbHash) cache, and those cache forever (immutable per content hash). After
// the backfill completes every referenced hash is complete → cached, and
// renders stop touching the network entirely.
